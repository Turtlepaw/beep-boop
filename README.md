### Notices
- **ðŸ”Ž We need help!** We're looking for beta testers willing to test the bot for bugs, [sign up here](https://bop.trtle.xyz/beta).
- **ðŸ§ª Dashboard is in a experimental state:** Many dashboard pages haven't been completed, and they are extremely unstable.
- **ðŸš§ Unstable and limited API:** The API hasn't been tested yet, and there are limited public and internal routes available.

### Welcome
Welcome to Beep Boop's Github repository, here you'll find all the source to Beep Boop.

### Contributing Guidelines
- Make sure to use our custom classes (e.g. `Selector`, `Filter`, etc...) found in [`src/utils`](https://github.com/Turtlepaw/beep-boop/blob/37dea1b4eec22005c7d67835f7fb91964729dc59/src/utils).

### Website Guidelines (wip)
- ~~Always show if the user has no JavaScript enabled.~~ (this hasn't been added yet)
- The branding pages should use little or no JavaScript.

### Software Requirements
- Yarn (3.4.1 or latest)
- Node.js (18.13.0 or latest)

## Styling Code and Files
### Comments
Add a space after the `//` so that your comments look nice!

```ts
// Here's a comment
```

## Files & Directories
We're trying to keep file naming consistent, although some files aren't consistent. When creating a new file start off with an uppercase, like this:

```
-> MyDirectory
    -> DirectoryUtils.ts
```

### Upcoming Changes
Here's the internal roadmap and the public roadmap.
